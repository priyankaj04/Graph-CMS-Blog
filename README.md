## Overview


Balanced is a full-stack blog web application that allows users to explore a variety of blog posts, comment on them, and even publish their own content. The app showcases the power of modern web technologies, particularly Next.js, GraphQL, and GraphCMS, in creating a dynamic and responsive blogging platform.


## Features


* `Browse Blogs`: Easily browse through the latest blog posts, with options to filter by category.
* `Comment on Blogs`: Engage with the content by leaving comments on blog posts.
* `Publish Blogs`: Upload and manage your own blog posts directly through the platform using GraphCMS.
* `Author Information`: Learn more about the authors behind the blogs.


## Database Schemas


* `Authors`: Stores information about blog authors, including name, bio, and social links.
* `Blog`: Contains the blog posts themselves, with fields for title, content, categories, and author.
* `Comments`: Manages user comments on blog posts, linked to both the blog and the user who commented.


## Technologies Used

* `Next.js`: A powerful React framework for server-rendered and static web applications.
* `JavaScript`: The programming language used to build dynamic web features.
* `GraphQL`: A query language for your API, enabling precise data fetching.
* `GraphCMS`: A headless CMS that provides a content management system for the blogs.
* `Tailwind CSS`: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.


## How It Works

* `Explore Blogs`: Users can navigate through the home page to view recent blog posts or select a specific category to find relevant content.

* `Commenting`: Readers can engage with the content by leaving comments. Each comment is associated with a user and the specific blog post.

* `Publishing Blogs`: Authorized users can upload new blog posts through GraphCMS. This allows for easy content management and updating.

* `Author Profiles`: Each blog post is linked to an author, providing readers with additional context and background about the person behind the content.
